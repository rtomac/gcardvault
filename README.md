# Overview

Gcardvault is a command-line utility which exports all of a user's Google Contacts in vCard/VCF format for backup (or portability).

Features:
- Automatically discovers all of a user's contacts
- Downloads them in vCard/VCF format and saves them to disk for archival
- Optionally manages version history for each contact in an on-disk "vault" (a git repo under the covers)
- Can be run via Docker image (multi-arch) or installed directly as a Python package with command-line interface

# How it works

- Uses Google's [Identity Provider](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) to authenticate (via OAuth2/OIDC)
- Uses Google's [People API](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/) to discover a user's contacts
- Uses Google's [CardDAV endpoints](https://developers.google.com/people/carddav) to download vCard/VCF contacts
- Uses [GitPython](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io) to manage local git repo for version history under the covers

# Usage

Some example commands...

Sync all contacts for `foo.bar@gmail.com` user:
```
gcardvault sync foo.bar@gmail.com
```

Simply export contacts, do not save version history:
```
gcardvault sync foo.bar@gmail.com --export-only
```

See the [CLI help](https://github.com/rtomac/gcardvault/blob/main/src/gcardvault/USAGE.txt) for full usage and other notes.

# Requirements

- Python 3.9+

# Installation

## Via PyPi

```
pip install gcardvault
gcardvault sync foo.bar@gmail.com
```

## Via Docker

```
docker run -it --rm \
    -v ${HOME}/.gcardvault:/root/.gcardvault \
    -v ${PWD}/gcardvault:/root/gcardvault \
    rtomac/gcardvault sync foo.bar@gmail.com
```

# OAuth2 authentication

The CLI initiates an OAuth2 authentication the first time it is run (interactive), and then uses refresh tokens for subsequent runs (headless).

When you use Gcardvault in its default configuration, you are initiating the OAuth2 flow with Google using Gcardvault's client ID. There is nothing inherently insecure about this, since the application is running locally and therefore only *you* will have access to the data it reads from Google.

That said, it is recommended to create your own client ID through the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), since the shared client ID may be used by others and subject to limits which may cause unpredictable failures.

[rclone](https://rclone.org) has a good write-up on [making your own client ID](https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id).

You can provide your client ID and secret to gcardvault as follows:
```
gcardvault sync foo.bar@gmail.com --client-id my_client_id --client-secret my_client_secret
```

If you are providing your own Google OAuth2 client, you will need to ensure the following APIs and OAuth2 scopes are enabled for the project/client in GCP.

Google APIs:
- People API: `people.googleapis.com`
- Google Contacts CardDAV API: `carddav.googleapis.com`

OAuth2 scopes:
- `openid`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/carddav`
