Exports all of a user's Google Contacts in vCard/VCF format for backup (or portability).

Usage:
  gcardvault sync <user>
  gcardvault sync <user> --export-only
  gcardvault -h | --help
  gcardvault --version

Options:
  user              Required. Google username/email address,
                    e.g. foo.bar@gmail.com.
  -e --export-only  Export contacts to output dir only, do not create and
                    manage version history in a vault.
  -f --clean        Force clean the output directory, actively removing
                    .vcf files that are no longer being synced from Google.
  -c --conf-dir     Directory where configuration is stored (e.g. access
                    token). Defaults to ~/.gcardvault.
  -o --output-dir --vault-dir
                    Directory to which contact .vcf files are exported
                    and/or stored. Defaults to the current working directory.
  --client-id       Recommended. Custom OAuth2 client ID you've provisioned
                    with Google to use when authorizing user access.
  --client-secret   Client secret for custom client ID provided
                    via --client-id.
  -h --help         Show this help screen.
  --version         Show the program's version.

This program will discover all of a user's contacts (via Google's People
API) and export each of them as a .vcf file.

The sync function is meant to be used in one of two ways:
- As a simple export utility (via --export-only).
- As a backup utility, with version history for each of the contacts exported
  (default behavior). Version history is stored under the covers in a git
  repository managed by gcardvault.
